can you check if the highlevel architecture excalidraw file and architecture with java concenpts file are consistent. DONT blindly agree with me, i want you to actaully check  
  them and tell me what discrepencies are there, if any. after also compare it to architecture diagram, basic working , beginner over files too. tell me what chnages have been   
  made, if any. Before all this confirm that the high level architecture excalidraw is actaully correct with respect to the code of the project.
