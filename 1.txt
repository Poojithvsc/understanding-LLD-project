 🎯 Project: E-Commerce Order Processing System

  Technologies You'll Learn:
  - ☕ Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.x
  - 📨 Apache Kafka (message broker)
  - 🗄️ PostgreSQL (primary database)
  - ⚡ Redis (caching)
  - ☁️ AWS S3 / LocalStack (cloud storage)
  - 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose
  - 🧪 JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers (testing)
  - 📊 Prometheus & Grafana (monitoring)

  What You'll Build:
  5 microservices working together in an event-driven architecture:
  1. Order Service - Manages orders
  2. Inventory Service - Tracks stock
  3. Payment Service - Processes payments
  4. Notification Service - Sends notifications
  5. File Storage Service - Handles invoices/receipts in S3

  💡 Key Learning Principles

  1. Start Small - Begin with one service, master it, then move on
  2. Test-Driven - Write tests as you code, not after
  3. Document as You Go - Update design docs when you make changes
  4. Commit Frequently - Small, meaningful commits
  5. Learn by Doing - Build real features, not just tutorials
  6. Industry Standards - Follow best practices from day one
